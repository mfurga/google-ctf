# Gate lock (hardware)

So close!!   You have landed.  Getting to the farm was no problem, but these poor, helpless, if not stunning creatures are trapped behind a gate and a fence.

You barely have experience with three dimensional objects, none the less physical matter  in this particular dimension's structure of forces. (Flag format is binary surrounded by CTF{...})
